February 2012: Initial work (not in use anywhere yet) to make more flexible queries
into the image archive.

Currently, we have to add X.<something> tags to the taxonomy hierarchy to have queries
like "Paranal" (https://www.eso.org/public/videos/archive/category/paranal/). To avoid
these local use tags, we want to use only e.g. subject name and subject category to
decide what should be in the "Paranal" image category. This is the initial work in allowing
these queries to be defined via the admin. See more on http://www.djangoplicity.org/bugs/view.php?id=3065
