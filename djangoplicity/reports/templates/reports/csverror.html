<h1>Excel Users: CSV-file contains special characters</h1>
<p>Microsoft Excel will not be able to successfully open this file as a normal
CSV-file due to special characters in the file.
To successfully load the file, you must use Excel's import feature.</p>
<p>First, download the CSV file with special characters linked to below.
Then in Excel, go to the menu <strong>Data > Get External Data > Import Text
Fie</strong>. In the window, chose your file type to be <strong>Delimited</strong> and the
file origin to be <strong>Unicode (UTF-8)</strong>. Choosing the right file origin is
crucial for correct import of the special characters. Choose <strong>Comma</strong> as
delimiter when asked. The rest can be specified as desired.</p><p>Note: Other programs
might also have problems reading this file. Please ensure the file is read as an UTF-8
encoded file.</p>
